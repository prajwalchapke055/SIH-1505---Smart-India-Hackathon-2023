  Geospatial Technology: Implement GIS (Geographic Information Systems) to map and visualize the data, providing detailed insights into hazard distribution.
  
4] Hazard Zone Maps :
  Mapping: Create detailed maps categorizing different areas within the industrial facility into flammability, toxicity, and threat zones.
  Purpose: Facilitate easy identification and monitoring of high-risk areas.

5] Fire Pre-Plans :
  Proactive Strategies: Develop strategies to prevent fires and manage emergencies effectively.
  Implementation: Use the hazard zone maps to inform and design fire prevention and emergency response plans.

6] Enhanced Safety :
  Safety Measures: Improve overall safety and emergency preparedness for industrial workers and assets.
  Training: Train personnel based on the identified hazard zones and fire pre-plans.
  
7] Economic Loss Reduction :
  Minimization of Losses: Reduce potential economic losses resulting from industrial fires by taking preventive measures based on accurate hazard identification.
  Cost-Benefit Analysis: Highlight the economic benefits of investing in advanced hazard identification technologies.

## Use Cases : 
1] Industrial Safety: Enhance workplace safety by proactively managing fire and safety risks.
2] Emergency Response: Aid first responders in minimizing risks during fire emergencies.
3] Environmental Protection: Identify and contain environmental threats to prevent hazards.
4] Regulatory Compliance: Ensure adherence to safety regulations and demonstrate commitment to public safety.
5] Preventive Maintenance: Mitigate risks through timely maintenance measures.
6] Urban Planning: Safely integrate industrial areas into urban landscapes.
7] Insurance Assessment: Accurately assess and underwrite policies based on hazard mapping data.
